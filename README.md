# Blog built with Nuxt

This repository is the abode of my digital dojo hosted on [sagarkapoor.eu](https://sagarkapoor.eu).
The list of tools used to work on its infrastructure is as follows:

- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) for the front end.
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) to set up the development environment.

## About the Project

We all have something to share. This is a piece of real estate to do exactly that.

## Usage & Development Guidelines

You will need these tools to get started with dev work on this software:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
3. [Task](https://taskfile.dev/)
4. [Pre Commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

## Steps required to get your dev environment up and running

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the tools mentioned above.
3. Run `task setup` once step 1 is complete. All `task` commands should be run from the
   root directory.
4. Run `task dev` to run the development version of the website locally.
5. Run `task qa-checks` to lint and format your code before making a commit.
6. Run `task default` to check the list of all available `tasks`.

Once you are have completed the setup, check out the
[issues](https://github.com/Sagar-Kap/sagarkapoor/issues) in this repository and then open a
[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
which will get merged to the `main` branch after a review.
