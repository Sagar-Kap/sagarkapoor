# Blog built with Nuxt

This repository is the abode of my digital dojo hosted on [sagarkapoor.eu](https://sagarkapoor.eu).
The list of tools used to work on its infrastructure is as follows:

- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) for the front end.
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) to set up the development environment.

## About the Project

We all have something to share. This is a piece of real estate to do exactly that.

## Usage & Development Guidelines

You will need these tools to get started with dev work on this software:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
3. [Task](https://taskfile.dev/)
4. [Pre Commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

## Steps required to get your dev environment up and running

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local environment.
3. Install the tools mentioned above.
4. Run `task setup` once step 1 is complete. All `task` commands should be run from the
   root directory.
5. Run `task dev` to run the development version of the website locally.
6. Run `task qa-checks` to lint and format your code before making a commit.
7. Run `task default` to check the list of all available `tasks`.

Once you are have completed the setup, check out the
[issues](https://github.com/Sagar-Kap/sagarkapoor/issues) in this repository and then open a
[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
which will get merged to the `main` branch after a review.
